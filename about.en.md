## About Aleph

> [Aleph](https://docs.aleph.occrp.org/) is a powerful tool for people who follow the money. It helps investigators to securely access and search large amounts of data - no matter whether they are a government database or a leaked email archive. Aleph is developed and maintained by the [Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)](https://occrp.org) and a growing open source community (of which [investigativedata.io](https://github.com/investigativedata/) is part of).


Aleph is mostly known for the [public instance run by OCCRP](https://aleph.occrp.org). But it is as well a software that any organization can run internally. This enables an investigative boost for research teams:

- Upload documents to a secure space only your team has access to
- Cross-reference documents with structured data such as company registries or [sanctions lists](https://www.opensanctions.org/)
- Build a knowledge graph about all of your investigative data over time
- Build an extensive archive of all your organizations research material
- Find connections in historic and current material to gain new leads
